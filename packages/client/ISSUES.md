# Issues

- Collision detection doesn't seem to be a simple thing to add
    - Not sure if it's b/c of the networking code that was added?
    - Might be mashing together too many separate paradigms accidentally
- Simulated Network player floats
- No actual server implemented yet
- Unclear if the Networking approach will actually work as expected
    - How to verify?
